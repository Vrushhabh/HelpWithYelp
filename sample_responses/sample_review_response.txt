The thing that makes Santa Barbara Adventure a world class touring firm is their employees who are very passionate about what they do. Our guide Brendon was a very likable gentleman from the get-go. His attention to detail be it the history and geography of the coastline to the safety of his participants was impeccable. He put out a wonderful food spread halfway through the trip that gave us time to explore the tidal pools and wonderful stretch of central California shoreline where we beached and a little time to swim and relax before heading back. Thanks Brendon we all had a great time. Next year a sojourn to Anacapa!
