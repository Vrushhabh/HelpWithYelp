## Project Summary

We aim to create an interactive tool which would allow business owners to gain insight into the factors which may be responsible for the successes and failures of their own business and others in its category. To accomplish this, we will use a business, review, and user dataset from Yelp, a crowd-sourced business review platform.

With our tool, businesses can easily get a sense of the most common attributes of successful businesses (e.g. businesses with an average user rating > 4) in its category (e.g. sushi restaurants in Chicago). A business would be able to search by area, tags, and other attributes which would allow it to plan out a viable opening strategy, for example. We will also allow businesses to update the database from which our tool pulls to limit manual maintenance. For example, a business would be able to indicate that it is permanently closed or that its hours have changed.
